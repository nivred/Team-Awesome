# Brain Dead

## Description
This web application is a zombie themed memory card game that challenges users to match any pair of cards of the same image. Each game played is timed and records how long it takes to complete. Users who hold the Top 10 record times are displayed within the Stats page.  

## How to Play
Once registered and logged in, click on any card to reveal the image hidden beneath. Then randomly click any other card to find a match. Cards will automatically flip back down on the 3rd click of an additional card. Game ends once all cards have been matched.
